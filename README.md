# ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡ 200IQ DB
A multi-page React app utilising the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/api) to display characters. Also has a sample form for creating characters (doesn't actually create anything, just prints the data to console). Form validation is done through the [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) npm package.
Check out the app [here.](https://siryeast.github.io/200iq-db/)
